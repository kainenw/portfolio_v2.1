## Development Workflow Integration

### Automated Testing Setup
The portfolio now includes comprehensive automated accessibility testing integrated into the development workflow:

#### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# GitHub Actions automatically run on:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests to main/develop
- Manual workflow dispatch
```

#### npm Scripts
```bash
# Available accessibility testing commands:
npm run test:accessibility  # Full accessibility test suite
npm run test:a11y          # Shorthand command
```

#### Git Hooks Integration
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Quick accessibility validation before commits
- **Post-merge Hook**: Reminder to run accessibility tests after merges

### Setting Up Automation (One-time Setup)
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
./setup-accessibility-automation.sh

# Or manually set up Git hooks
./setup-git-hooks.sh
```

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of headings, landmarks, and semantic elements
- [ ] **ARIA Attributes**: Correct implementation of ARIA labels and roles
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- [ ] **Focus Management**: Logical focus order and visible focus indicators
- [ ] **Color Accessibility**: Sufficient contrast ratios and no color-only information

### Pre-Deployment Testing
```bash
# Automated accessibility test suite
npm run test:accessibility

# Or run the comprehensive script directly
./test-accessibility.sh

# Verify zero errors before deployment
echo "✅ All accessibility tests must pass before deployment"
```

### CI/CD Integration Details

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
The automated testing workflow:
1. **Triggers**: On push/PR to main branches
2. **Environment Setup**: Node.js, dependencies, build
3. **Server Start**: Launches development server
4. **Test Execution**: Runs pa11y, Lighthouse, and axe-core tests
5. **Results Analysis**: Checks for violations and generates reports
6. **Artifact Storage**: Saves test results for 30 days
7. **PR Comments**: Posts test results summary on pull requests
8. **Build Status**: Fails build if accessibility violations found

#### Automated Failure Thresholds
- **Zero tolerance**: Any accessibility violations fail the build
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: All tests must pass WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Tests all main pages and user flows

#### Notification and Reporting
- **PR Comments**: Automated accessibility test results
- **Build Status**: Pass/fail indicators in GitHub
- **Detailed Reports**: Full test results in GitHub Actions artifacts
- **Email Notifications**: GitHub settings control team notifications

### Git Hooks Integration
```bash
# Pre-commit hook behavior:
- Checks if development server is running
- Runs quick pa11y test on homepage
- Allows commit if no violations found
- Provides helpful error messages and suggestions

# Post-merge hook behavior:
- Reminds developers to run full accessibility tests
- Suggests running npm run test:accessibility
```

### Troubleshooting Automated Testing

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build Failing Due to Accessibility Violations:**
```bash
# 1. Run tests locally to reproduce
npm run test:accessibility

# 2. Review detailed reports in accessibility-test-results/
open accessibility-test-results/accessibility-summary.html

# 3. Fix violations following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
# 4. Re-run tests to verify fixes
# 5. Commit and push fixed code
```

**Pre-commit Hook Issues:**
```bash
# If pre-commit hook fails:
# 1. Ensure development server is running
npm start

# 2. Run accessibility test manually
npm run test:accessibility

# 3. Fix any violations found
# 4. Try committing again

# To skip hook temporarily (not recommended):
git commit --no-verify
```

**GitHub Actions Workflow Issues:**
```bash
# Check workflow status at:
https://github.com/[username]/portfolio_v2/actions

# Common fixes:
# 1. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
# 2. Verify test-accessibility.sh has correct permissions
# 3. Check for any new accessibility violations
```
