        <h3>Let&apos;s support Mozilla</h3>
        <p>I love Mozilla and you should too.</p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s a low bar, but Mozilla is the best of the four major client-side internet companies: Apple, Google,
          Mozilla, and Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p>I encourage everyone to support Mozilla any way you can.</p>
        <p>
          There are paid versions of this resource which allow you to follow topics to stay on top of trends. This is
          super useful and I would encourage you to support Mozilla any way you can. There are also several other
          services like a vpn that they provide. This isn’t sponsored content, I just really love Mozilla. Maybe I’ll
          make a post another time about why.
